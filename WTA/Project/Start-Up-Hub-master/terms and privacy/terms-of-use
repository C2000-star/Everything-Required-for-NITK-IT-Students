(Prior TOU version dated 14 March 2018.)<br></p><p>Want to contact us about this TOU? Legal issues should be addressed to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@moz.com" target="_blank">legal@moz.com</a>. All other issues should be addressed to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@moz.com" target="_blank">help@moz.com.</a></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;Overview and Important Definitions</strong></p><p>A. This Terms of Use ("TOU") is a legally binding contract between SEOmoz, Inc. ("Moz") and you, as a user of or subscriber to Moz sites or services. The most current versions of the Moz Privacy Policy and Moz Community Etiquette are incorporated into this TOU by this reference, and supersede and replace all prior versions of the same. </p><p>B. Moz offers businesses and individuals access to resources for search engine optimization, online marketing, and online local business listing management, including, without limitation, link analysis tools, downloadable toolbars, application program interfaces ("APIs"), software as a service available on a subscription basis (e.g., Moz Pro and Moz Local), website profile services, search analytics, blogs, user-generated/personalized content tools, industry surveys, and opinion polls (any or all are “Services”). </p><p>C. Moz Services are available from Moz web domains, including, without limitation, Moz.com and MozCast.com ("Sites"). </p><p>D. TOU Acceptance and Agreement; Users and Subscribers.</p><p>(1.) By accessing or using any Sites or Services, or by clicking or checking a box indicating “I agree,” “I accept,” or any similar expression of agreement while purchasing or obtaining access to any portion of any Sites or Services, you agree to be legally bound by this TOU. (Please print a copy of this TOU for your records.) <em>If you do not agree to the TOU, you are not authorized to use and you must cease using any Sites or Services</em>.</p><p>(2.) You may access portions of any Sites or Services with a free account as a user ("User"). While access to certain other portions of the Sites and selected features of the Services is free, Moz may charge fees for features and benefits associated with any Sites or Services at any time. Any User who pays to access or use parts of the Sites or Services is a "Subscriber" in this TOU. References to the terms “you” or “your” in the TOU refer to Users or Subscribers, as applicable. &nbsp;</p><p>(3.) If you accept this TOU on behalf of any other person(s) or organization(s), then you represent to Moz that you are legally authorized to do so, and “you” or “your” therefore also includes those other person(s) or organization(s). </p><p>E. Moz may revise and update this TOU at any time for any reason in its sole and absolute discretion, effective immediately on posting the same to the Sites. The TOU will indicate at the beginning (top of the page) the date on which the current TOU was last revised and effective. It is your responsibility to check the then-current TOU for any changes. YOU AGREE THAT THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THIS TOU LEGALLY BINDS YOU FOR ANY OF YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF THE SITES AND ANY SERVICES, AND YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MOST RECENT TOU VERSION SUPERSEDES AND REPLACES THE PRIOR VERSION AND BINDS YOU FOR THE ENTIRETY OF ANY UNEXPIRED AND ACTIVE TERMS OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS TO ANY SERVICES. &nbsp;</p><p>F. If you enter into a separate written agreement with Moz, executed physically or digitally (e.g. DocuSign®) by both you and Moz, for you to access or use any Sites or Services (“Other Moz Agreement”), to the extent that the terms of any Other Moz Agreement conflict with the terms of this TOU, the conflicting terms of such Other Moz Agreement will override the conflicting terms of this TOU unless the Other Moz Agreement states the contrary.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Terms and Conditions Governing API Usage</strong></p><p>A. As a Service, Moz may provide application program interfaces and accompanying software code and documentation (any or all are “Mozscape API”) to access and use proprietary Moz information and data about URLs (“Moz Data”). </p><p>B. If Moz provides you any Mozscape API via a secret access key, subject to this TOU, then Moz grants you a worldwide, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to make a reasonable number of copies of and use the Mozscape API to access Moz Data to use other Services. If you use or publicly display any Moz Data accessed with any Mozscape API, you also will comply with any Moz link and attribution guidelines on the Sites from time to time. </p><p>C. You may not resell or redistribute any proprietary Moz API that Moz licensed to you or any Moz Data via your own API or offer it to any third parties.</p><p>D. Moz reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to any Mozscape API at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. If your access to any Mozscape API is suspended or terminated, you have no rights associated with such Mozscape API and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to any refund or other compensation whatsoever.</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Terms and Conditions Governing Software as a Service Use and Subscriptions</strong></p><p>Certain Services include Moz proprietary software as a service accessed and used from the Sites, including Moz Local and Moz Pro; if you are a User of or Subscriber to any such Services, then you are also subject to the following specific terms and conditions. &nbsp;</p><p>A. Terms and Conditions Governing Moz Local Subscriptions</p><p> If you purchase from any of the Sites subscriptions Moz Local to manage business listing information and/or location data using Moz Local, you are subject to the TOU and particularly the following related to your Moz Local subscription(s).</p><p>(1.) Fees. You agree to immediately pay Moz for each managed location for recurring one-year terms beginning on the date of each payment (all payments are "Moz Local Service Fees"). Moz incurs third-party costs for each Moz Local Subscriber immediately after the Subscriber submits data to Moz Local, so you agree that ALL PAYMENTS ARE FINAL and Moz is not obligated whatsoever for any partial or complete refunds, including for any renewal payments described in paragraph (3.) below.</p><p>(2.) Scope of Services. Subject to this TOU (including payment), Moz will distribute data to certain location data aggregators and business listing services and may offer additional reports and tools related to this data. These services are described in greater detail on the Sites.</p><p>(3.) Renewal.&nbsp;Each business location renews annually within 30 days of the anniversary of the previous payment for that location. If your renewal payment fails, you will no longer have any rights under this TOU related to your previously purchased Moz Local business location(s), including the right to manage your business listing, until your payments are current. Failure to renew a listing in a timely manner (prior to the date of annual renewal) will result in loss of any special or custom pricing terms associated with a business location.</p><p>(4.) Pricing Changes.&nbsp;Moz may change its Moz Local Service Fees from time to time; with respect to new pricing for renewals, Moz will provide at least thirty (30) days’ notice by email and/or posting any new fee schedule on the Site for Moz Local.</p><p>(5.) Customer Management of Each Business Location and Listing.</p><p>(a.) Cancellation.&nbsp;You may cancel a managed business location only using the Moz Local dashboard. Cancellation is immediate, irreversible and must occur prior to expiration of the business location term to avoid related renewal fees. Cancellation removes a listing and associated data from your dashboard. Your cancellation of any business location will not under any circumstances entitle you to any complete or partial refunds whatsoever for such cancelled business location.</p><p>(b.) Changes and Updates.&nbsp;You may make unlimited changes and updates to business location data during the related term. However, if you make changes to core data &mdash; such as domain name, phone number, or location address &mdash; that Moz is unable to validate using third-party services such as Google or Facebook, Moz may not be able to update your changes with location data aggregators and business listing services following submission. This validation policy protects you and other customers from having business locations listing data hijacked by unauthorized agents.</p><p>(6.) Additional Moz Local Subscriber Obligations and Acknowledgements. You acknowledge and agree as follows:</p><p>(a.) By purchasing Moz Local listings, you warrant that you own each listing or are otherwise authorized to represent the business location as of when you pay the related Moz Local Service Fees.</p><p>(b.) To periodically review and confirm the accuracy of submitted business listing information.</p><p>(c.) Moz may occasionally require you to submit proof by email of authorization to represent a Moz Local business location, and failure to comply with any request may result in cancellation of your listing(s). </p><p>(d.) Your business location listing(s) may be transferred to another person or entity if that person or entity can sufficiently demonstrate resulting ownership (no such transfer will result in any refunds, however).</p><p>(e.) Another agent may submit information to Moz Local or a location listing provider which may override information you submitted about a business location.</p><p>(f.) The Moz Local Services send location data to third-party location listing providers who may use this data in any way, and Moz cannot control their use once the data is sent to them.</p><p>(g.) Location data aggregators and business listing services are not obligated to accept your listing, or any of the information you submit via Moz Local related to a business location.</p><p>(h.) Moz reserves complete right and discretion to change the mix of Moz Local location data aggregators and business listing services.</p><p>B.&nbsp;Terms and Conditions Governing Subscriptions to All Other Moz Software as a Service</p><p>These Services also include subscriptions to Moz Pro and other software as a service offerings (e.g., Content, Analytics, etc.), and are subject to the TOU and the following obligations specific to Moz Pro and such other software as a service offerings by Moz.</p><p>(1.) Subscription Payment.&nbsp;Subscribers must agree to the payment terms presented at the time you sign up for any Services. You are responsible for acting prior to renewal if you do not want to renew automatically. You may not receive notice of your renewal after subscribing, and you must visit your Subscription and Billing page to find out when your subscription renews. Subscriptions recur either monthly or annually in most cases, depending on the renewal term you choose on signup. You must ensure that the credit card information used for your account or subscription is current and accurate, and that you are authorized to use that credit card. Moz may implement fraud-protection measures anytime including, without limitation, temporarily charging small amounts to validate your credit card and authorization.</p><p>(2.) Subscription Cancellation.&nbsp;For security, an email or phone call to Moz is not sufficient to cancel your Services subscription. You may cancel at any time by selecting the cancel button on your Subscription and Billing page. Cancellation does not entitle you to any refund whatsoever. You will continue to have access to the Sites and Services you have paid for until the end of your subscription term, but will lose access if the subscription is not in good standing.</p><p>(3.) No Refunds.&nbsp;Moz will not provide you any refunds at any time. If you cancel your subscription, Moz is not obligated to refund fees for any portion of your subscription term. If you choose to downgrade your subscription during your subscription term, you may be entitled to a pay a lower, prorated amount as of the date of renewal, but you are not entitled to any refund at any time.</p><p>(4.) Multiple Subscriptions.&nbsp;Each subscription has a credit card associated with it. If a subscription is suspended for inability to process that credit card, and you subscribe to a second Moz Service while that first Service is suspended (e.g. changing the credit card for the new subscription) but before the original subscription is cancelled (currently 18 days, subject to change), Moz may use the valid payment credit card for the second subscription to reinitiate the suspended Service.</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;Terms and Conditions Governing All Users of and Subscribers to Sites or Services</strong></p><p>A. The Services are available only to Users and Subscribers who:</p><ol><li>Are human (not bots, except for certain authorized API users) and with minimum ages of 13 years old for Users and 18 years old for Subscribers;</li><li>Submit and then maintain truthful and accurate account information;</li><li>Do not impersonate any other person or entity or otherwise misrepresent their identity in a profile or elsewhere on the Sites;</li><li>Have a valid email address; and</li><li>Do not to authorize third parties unaffiliated through an employer-employee or entity ownership relationship to use their account, profile, or messages or otherwise resell the Services to multiple unaffiliated persons or parties (e.g. “group buys” or “buyers’ clubs”).</li></ol><p>B. You agree that you have or will enter into agreements with your individual users who access any Sites or Services on your behalf that protect Moz, and any Moz Content, Sites, or Services as much as this TOU.</p><p>C. If Moz, through any Sites, Services, or otherwise, provides you user authentication and access tools (i.e., user name, password, access keys, etc.) for secure access to any Site or Services, you agree to keep that account access information protected, secure, and confidential, and not share it with others in any way that breaches this TOU. You agree that Moz in its sole and absolute discretion may block you from any secure and restricted parts of any Sites or Services. You also agree to notify Moz immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of secure and restricted parts of any Sites or Services that you (including but not limited to any of your users) know or should reasonably know about.</p><p>D. You agree that your rights in a subscription or use of any paid Services (including, for example, the ability to change a password associated with a Moz Pro account) may depend on demonstrating that you have paid for the subscription to any applicable Services or Sites.</p><p>E. You acknowledge that if you sign up for any Services and pay via credit card, and Moz cannot charge your credit card at renewal, Moz may cancel your subscription and you may lose access to the Services and any data associated with your subscription.</p><p>F. While some Services may be paid for via invoice pursuant to an Other Moz Agreement, Moz may quote additional fees for invoiced accounts. If Moz has entered into an invoicing relationship with you, the following terms apply unless superseded by an Other Moz Agreement: You agree to pay all undisputed invoices within 30 days. You agree that Moz may charge interest of 1.5% per month for past due invoices, or the highest rate permitted by law, and you are liable for reasonable attorney fees and collection costs arising from Moz's efforts to collect on past due amounts. If you fail to pay an invoice, Moz reserves the right to cancel your subscription and access to any Sites or Services, and any data associated with your subscription or the Services.</p><p>G. Taxes. The price, fees, and other amounts payable to Moz under this TOU do not include any sales, use, or other similar taxes assessed or imposed by any governmental authority. With regard to such amounts, you will pay or reimburse Moz for all such charges as invoiced or provide certificates or other evidence of exemption.</p><p>H. You acknowledge that portions of the Sites and Services are publicly available or available to other Users and may be accessible by syndication programs (including data feed tools), search engines, metasearch tools, crawlers, metacrawlers, and other similar programs.</p><p>I. Moz reserves the right to monitor your communications to the extent they are facilitated by any Sites or Services, and may disclose content and information about you, including content contained within your communications, if Moz deems it reasonably necessary to: (1.) conform to legal requirements or respond to legal process; (2.) ensure your compliance with this TOU, the Moz Privacy Policy, and/or the Moz Community Etiquette; or (3.) protect the rights, property, personal safety, or interests of Moz, its employees, customers, or the public.</p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;User Obligations Regarding User-Generated Content</strong></p><p>You assume the following obligations with respect to any information, profiles, data, text, links, articles, software, photographs, graphics, video, music, sound, messages, or other materials that a you upload, publish, or display on or through any Sites or Services, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted (“User-Generated Content”):</p><ul><li>You assume legal responsibility for all your User-Generated Content.</li><li>You agree that no proprietary rights including but not limited to copyright, trademark, trade secret, publicity or privacy rights, or any other intellectual property rights are being violated by your posting, transmission or sharing of any User-Generated Content via any Sites or Services.</li><li>You agree not to post, transmit, or share User-Generated Content on any Sites or Services that you:</li><ul><li>Lack authority or permission to post, transmit, or share, or </li><li>That violates in any way the rights of other persons or solicits, encourages, or promotes illegal activities, including but not limited to activities that threaten, abuse in any way, harass, defame, libel, disparage, invade the privacy or publicity rights of other persons or that are vulgar, obscene, bigoted or hateful, profane, scandalous, obscene.</li></ul></ul><p><strong>6.&nbsp;No Moz Responsibility for User-Generated Content</strong></p><p>Moz assumes no obligations to screen and does not routinely pre-screen any User-Generated Content that you upload, publish, or display on or through any Sites or Services.

Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically acknowledge and agree that neither Moz nor any of its third-party suppliers is liable for the defamatory, offensive, infringing, breaching, fraudulent, or illegal conduct of other users, subscribers, or third parties and that any risk from the foregoing are assumed entirely by you. These limitations apply to any matter related to any Sites, Services, or their content; third-party Internet sites, programs, or conduct; viruses or other disabling features; incompatibility between any Sites or Services and other services, software, or hardware; and any delay or failure in initiating, conducting, or completing any transmission or transaction connected with any Sites or Services in an accurate or timely manner. </p><p>(3.) Limitation of Liability. Any liability of Moz or any of Moz’s third-party suppliers of any kind arising out of or related to this TOU (including but not limited to warranty claims) or any of your use of the Sites or Services, regardless of the forum and whether any action or claim is based on breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, shall not exceed the greater of (a.) the total amount paid by you to Moz to access or use any Sites or Services giving rise to such liability during the six (6) months immediately preceding the date the liability arose or (b.) twenty United States dollars (USD$20.00). </p><p>(4.) This Section 15.B. applies even if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails its essential purpose; or even if Moz or any of its third-party suppliers knew or should have known about the possibility of the losses, liability, or damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or limitation of liability for certain claims or causes of action, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you in these jurisdictions.</p><p><strong>16.&nbsp;Special Admonitions for International Use</strong></p><p>A. Your Internet use may be global; thus, you agree to comply with all local rules and laws regarding your access and use of any Sites or Services through the Internet, and without limitation, you will comply with all applicable laws regarding obscene and indecent content and transmitting technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.</p><p>B. With respect to any personal data (as defined under the&nbsp;<strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong>&nbsp;[<strong>GDPR</strong>] [EU] 2016/679 and any other applicable data protection legislation) (“Personal Data”) which Moz processes on your behalf, Moz Pro does not process any Personal Data as a part of its core function and Moz Local would only process Personal Data in the unlikely event that the business listing and location information managed by Moz Local were to include the Personal Data of data subject. Thus, Moz is more typically the Data Controller and is not a Data Processor to Personal Data in which you are a Data Controller. However, in the unlikely event that you believe Moz is a Data Processor to you as a Data Controller, please contact Moz at <a href="mailto:legal@moz.com">legal@moz.com</a>, and Moz can consider if it is necessary under applicable law for you to appoint Moz as a Data Processor pursuant to an appropriate Data Processor agreement/addendum.</p><p><strong>17. Termination</strong></p><p>Upon termination of Services, any payment liabilities owed to Moz and accrued prior to the effective date of the termination will survive. In addition to any obligations or restrictions in the TOU that by their nature should reasonably survive termination of this TOU, the following sections shall also survive termination of this TOU: 1.A., 1.D.(1.), 1.D.(3.), 1.F., 2.C., 3.A.(1.), 3.A.(6.)(a.), 3.B.(1.), 3.B.(3.), 4.C., 4.F., 4.G., 4.J., 5., 6., 7.C. to 7.E., 8., 9., and 11. to 18. You are solely responsible for removing your information and material from any Sites or Services prior to any termination. Moz is not obligated to retain your information, material, or data following termination.</p><p><strong>18.&nbsp;Miscellaneous Clauses</strong></p><p>A. Changes to Services. Moz may change any Sites or Services from time to time, with or without notice, by adding, modifying, suspending, or discontinuing features of such Sites or Services. Your access to and use of any Sites or Services depends on you complying with any applicable laws or this TOU.</p><p>B. Force Majeure. Neither you nor Moz will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this TOU if the delay or failure is due to circumstances beyond such party’s reasonable control. The affected party will notify the other party of such event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.</p><p>D. Notices. If Moz must send you additional information regarding the TOU or any Sites or Services, you consent to receiving this information electronically. Moz may provide required information to you by email at any address you registered with the Sites or Services or via posting on the Sites or Services. Notices provided to you via email are effective on the transmission date. You will provide Moz any written notice under this TOU by email to <a href="mailto:legal@moz.com">legal@moz.com</a>. </p><p>E. Forum and Jurisdiction. This TOU is governed by the laws of the State of Washington, USA, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington, USA to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that arises from this TOU.</p><p>F. Additional Rights and Obligations. This TOU shall neither obligate Moz, nor provide any rights, to any third-party whatsoever as an intended third-party beneficiary under this TOU. You and Moz are independent contractors without authority to bind each other or to make any representations on behalf of the other party, and you and Moz shall not be held to be partners or co-venturers. If any provision of this TOU is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be held superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision; the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Any party's failure to act with respect to a breach of this TOU does not constitute a waiver or affect that party's rights to act subsequently. You may not assign rights or delegate any duties under this TOU without prior written notice to and consent by Moz. This TOU will bind any permitted successors and permitted assigns.</p><p>G. Entire Agreement. The TOU (along with the Privacy Policy, Moz Community Etiquette, and any Subscriber agreement or other agreement accepted by you and an authorized representative of Moz that is incorporated by reference into the TOU) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Moz and governs your access to and use of any Sites or Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and Moz (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the TOU). In no case shall any terms on a purchase order or other non-Moz ordering document from you apply to, in addition to, or otherwise be included in the provisions of this TOU without Moz’s prior written consent and agreement. No modification of this TOU is binding unless it is in writing and signed by you and Moz.</p><p></p><p>Updated October 19, 2018</p></div></div></div></main>
